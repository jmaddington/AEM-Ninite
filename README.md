# Overview #
This directory contains a build package for an AEM Ninite component that supports all of Ninite's applications.

# Quick Use #
For quick use, download (https://github.com/jmaddington/AEM-Ninite/archive/master.zip) add your own NinitePro.exe, and icon.png if you'd like, and then run repackage.bat. 
From there, upload ninite.cpt to the Components section of your AEM.

## Running in AEM ##
Run the script, for whatever applications you want updated or installed choose "True" for the respective script variable.

# Updating Ninite Applications #
If Ninite updates their list of supported applications, you can update the script on your own by following the instructions in the provided Excel file. It's hacky, but it works.
